# Skytrak Golf Micro Aim Assistant

- A Java utility designed to allow for micro aim adjustments via the keyboard for the SkyTrak golf sim software.

## How to use
  * Alt + [ moves the cursor one pixel up
  * Alt + / moves the cursor one pixel down
  * Alt + ; moves the cursor one pixel left
  * Alt + ' moves the cursor one pixel right
  * Alt + a left clicks to finalize aiming position

## How to download 
  * Download both the GolfAim.jar and golf-launcher.bat files
  * Edit the golf-launcher.bat file to include your corrected file paths
  * Add the golf-launcher.bat file as a shortcut to your desktop

## How it works
  * When the golf-launcher.bat file runs, it simultaneously opens both the GolfAim.jar file and the SkyTrak app. GolfAim.jar will run in the background and allow for micro aim adjustments. When the SkyTrak window is terminated, GolfAim.jar will automatically be terminated as well.
